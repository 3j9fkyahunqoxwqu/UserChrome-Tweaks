# A community maintained repository of userChrome.css tweaks for Firefox

Every file should only contain a single, specific tweak. No full themes or anything. Users of this repository should be able to easily combine the different tweaks into a setup of their liking.

Each file should start with a comment containing:
* The goal of the CSS
* The contributors of the file

Incompatibilities between different files can happen. There's not much we can do about it. Just keep this in mind.
